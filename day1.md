1. Why lecture/what is it about
  - a couple of fundamentals

  - Two prime considerations
    - memory required
    - reducing number of operations

  - what is memory?
  - what are types?
    - civ // sc1 example
  - what does it mean to pass by reference or by value?

  - how does ruby handle types?
  - cool thing python does with storing common values

  - what is an array really?
  - **contiguous memory -- no need for pointers to elements!**
  - talk more about resizing and show it more with array operations
  - use that to paint the contrast to linked list
  - js arrays aren't arrays stop lying to me scientists!
  - show example in react project
  - but we do have typed arrays!
